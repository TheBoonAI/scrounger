# Adobe Premiere Plugin

_Coming Soon_ â€“ An Adobe Premier Plugin that brings the search power of
Scrounger into Adobe Premiere is in development. The plugin will allow editors
to access Scrounger natively in Premiere and import the results of their
searches directly into their projects. Check the issues in the Github repo for
updates on progress.
